# This is Turkish Python:
  every keyword transpiles to python keywords.
  **This language transpilation is pretty slight and not ideal for real applications**
# For Fun:
  This project is created just for fun! not for functioning!
# Installation:
  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/KoBruhh/Piton.git
  cd Piton
  cd src
  chmod +x install.sh
  ./install.sh
  piton test.ptn
  ```
# How?
  It just binds turkish keywords to english python. Thats why it is not scalable and practical for big projects (Strings get bind too!)
